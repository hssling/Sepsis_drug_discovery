Dear Editor,

We are pleased to submit our manuscript entitled **"Phase-Specific Host-Directed Therapy Targets in Sepsis: An Integrated Multi-omics and Chemoinformatics Pipeline Identifies IL-6, NLRP3, and PD-1 as Priority Candidates"** for consideration for publication in the *Indian Journal of Critical Care Medicine*.

## Summary

Sepsis remains the leading cause of death in intensive care units globally, with approximately 48.9 million cases and 11 million deaths annually. Despite over 100 clinical trials of immunomodulatory agents, no new drugs targeting the host immune response have been approved since the 1960s. This treatment gap represents a critical unmet medical need, particularly in resource-limited settings.

## Key Innovations

1. **Phase-Specific Targeting:** We address the fundamental reason for past trial failures—the biphasic immune response in sepsis. Our pipeline stratifies targets by immune phase (early hyperinflammation vs. late immunosuppression), enabling precision timing of interventions.

2. **Immediately Translatable Findings:** We identify FDA-approved drugs (Tocilizumab, Baricitinib, Anakinra, Colchicine) with existing safety profiles that can be rapidly repurposed through clinical trials.

3. **Computational Reproducibility:** Our open-source pipeline (https://github.com/hssling/Sepsis_drug_discovery) enables independent validation and extension to other conditions.

## Relevance to IJCCM

This work is highly relevant to the Indian critical care community for several reasons:
- **High sepsis burden in India:** India accounts for a significant proportion of global sepsis cases
- **Cost-effective approach:** Drug repurposing reduces development costs compared to novel drug discovery
- **Actionable findings:** Priority drugs are already available in Indian hospitals

## Declarations

- This manuscript has not been published previously and is not under consideration elsewhere
- All data are from publicly available databases (GEO, ChEMBL, Open Targets)
- No human subjects were involved (computational study)
- No conflicts of interest to declare
- The author approves the manuscript for submission
